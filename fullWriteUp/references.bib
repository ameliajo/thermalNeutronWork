	abstract = {Abstract The {ENDF}/B-{VII}.1 library is our latest recommended evaluated nuclear data file for use in nuclear science and technology applications, and incorporates advances made in the five years since the release of {ENDF}/B-{VII}.0. These advances focus on neutron cross sections, covariances, fission product yields and decay data, and represent work by the {US} Cross Section Evaluation Working Group ({CSEWG}) in nuclear data evaluation that utilizes developments in nuclear theory, modeling, simulation, and experiment. The principal advances in the new library are: (1) An increase in the breadth of neutron reaction cross section coverage, extending from 393 nuclides to 423 nuclides; (2) Covariance uncertainty data for 190 of the most important nuclides, as documented in companion papers in this edition; (3) R-matrix analyses of neutron reactions on light nuclei, including isotopes of He, Li, and Be; (4) Resonance parameter analyses at lower energies and statistical high energy reactions for isotopes of Cl, K, Ti, V, Mn, Cr, Ni, Zr and W; (5) Modifications to thermal neutron reactions on fission products (isotopes of Mo, Tc, Rh, Ag, Cs, Nd, Sm, Eu) and neutron absorber materials (Cd, Gd); (6) Improved minor actinide evaluations for isotopes of U, Np, Pu, and Am (we are not making changes to the major actinides 235,238U and 239Pu at this point, except for delayed neutron data and covariances, and instead we intend to update them after a further period of research in experiment and theory), and our adoption of {JENDL}-4.0 evaluations for isotopes of Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, and some other minor actinides; (7) Fission energy release evaluations; (8) Fission product yield advances for fission-spectrum neutrons and 14 {MeV} neutrons incident on 239Pu; and (9) A new decay data sublibrary. Integral validation testing of the {ENDF}/B-{VII}.1 library is provided for a variety of quantities: For nuclear criticality, the {VII}.1 library maintains the generally-good performance seen for {VII}.0 for a wide range of {MCNP} simulations of criticality benchmarks, with improved performance coming from new structural material evaluations, especially for Ti, Mn, Cr, Zr and W. For Be we see some improvements although the fast assembly data appear to be mutually inconsistent. Actinide cross section updates are also assessed through comparisons of fission and capture reaction rate measurements in critical assemblies and fast reactors, and improvements are evident. Maxwellian-averaged capture cross sections at 30 {keV} are also provided for astrophysics applications. We describe the cross section evaluations that have been updated for {ENDF}/B-{VII}.1 and the measured data and calculations that motivated the changes, and therefore this paper augments the {ENDF}/B-{VII}.0 publication [M.

	abstract = {Thermal neutron flux measurements made on a recently constructed
graphite-moderated natural uranium-fueled subcritical
pile have led to values of 52.6 cm. for the diffusion length
of thermal neutrons in graphite, and 1.19 x 10-4 cm.-2 for
the material buckling constant of the lattice.
In addition to the two parameters mentioned in the first
paragraph, three more were considered: the cadmimn ratio, the
Fermi age of neutrons in the lattice, and the infinite multiplication
factor. Physical significance was ascribed to each
of these, and methods for making experimental determinations
of them were given.
Furthermore, techniques for making the necessary thermal
neutron flux measurements and applying harmonic corrections
to these measurements were presented, along with a detailed
description of the pile from a structural standpoint.
Finally, the data obtained and the calculations used in
computing the diffusion length and the material buckling
will be found in Appendices A and B.},

	abstract = {Thermal neutron flux measurements made on a recently constructed
graphite-moderated natural uranium-fueled subcritical
pile have led to values of 52.6 cm. for the diffusion length
of thermal neutrons in graphite, and 1.19 x 10-4 cm.-2 for
the material buckling constant of the lattice.
In addition to the two parameters mentioned in the first
paragraph, three more were considered: the cadmimn ratio, the
Fermi age of neutrons in the lattice, and the infinite multiplication
factor. Physical significance was ascribed to each
of these, and methods for making experimental determinations
of them were given.
Furthermore, techniques for making the necessary thermal
neutron flux measurements and applying harmonic corrections
to these measurements were presented, along with a detailed
description of the pile from a structural standpoint.
Finally, the data obtained and the calculations used in
computing the diffusion length and the material buckling
will be found in Appendices A and B.},
