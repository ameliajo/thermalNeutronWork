\chapter{Accurate Representation of Phonon Distributions}

	\section{Discrete Oscillator Approximation for Phonon Spectra}
		Tell me why this is fundamentally different than the contin treatment. Actually go and walk through what NJOY manual is saying.

	\section{Representing Discrete Oscillators as Continuous Points in Freq. Dist.}
		\subsection{Equivalence of Revised-LEAPR to Legacy-LEAPR}
			As part of this project, I rewrote LEAPR in C++. Look at these plots, I did a good job.

		\subsection{Representing Discrete Oscillator as a Thin Triangle in Freq. Dist.}
			This is where I want to put how $S(\alpha,\beta)$ looks for $\delta$ vs. triangle of width 2, for many alpha, beta pairs.
		\subsection{$S(\alpha,\beta)$ Response to Changes in Triangle Size} 
			This is where I want to pick a few $\alpha$ values, and show how changing triangle size affects $S(\alpha,\beta)$

	\section{Nonuniform Phonon Distribution Energy Grid}
